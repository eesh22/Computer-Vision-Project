# Computer-Vision-Project
Diabetic Retinopathy is a significant microvascular complication of diabetes, often leading to vision impairment and blindness if left undetected and untreated. Early detection and precise monitoring of retinopathy lesions are paramount to improving patient outcomes and reducing the risk of severe complications. This project presents an innovative approach to automate the segmentation and measurement of diabetic retinopathy lesions in retinal images. The project comprises three fundamental stages. First, image pre-processing, involving resizing and conversion to grayscale, sets the foundation for subsequent analysis. Feature extraction is then performed using Histogram of Gradient (HoG) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF), enhancing the computational efficiency while preserving accuracy. The second stage involves utilizing SVM classification models to distinguish between normal and abnormal retinal images. Abnormal images are further classified into four distinct categories, representing different stages of diabetic retinopathy (Mild DR, Moderate DR, Severe DR, and Proliferative DR), employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project's significance lies in its potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy. Early detection facilitates timely intervention and improved treatment outcomes. Objective and accurate lesion assessment enhances diagnostic precision and monitoring. Personalized patient care plans, driven by precise measurements, optimize treatment and interventions. Moreover, the project contributes to the advancement of research into diabetic neuropathy by providing standardized lesion analysis.
